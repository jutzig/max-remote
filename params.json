{"name":"MAX! Remote","tagline":"Alternative App for controlling your MAX! Cube ","body":"### MAX! Remote\r\n[MAX! Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=de.jutzig.max.remote.activity) is an Android App that allows controlling the MAX! heating system via direct network connection or VPN tunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n### FAQ\r\n\r\n#### Why is the current temperature not shown?\r\nIf a room does not contain a wall thermostat the current temperature is retrieved from the heating thermostats. Unfortunately this method is not as reliable as using a wall thermostat and the current temperature will not always be available due to technical limitations of the MAX! system.\r\n\r\n#### Can I use MAX! Remote for adjusting my heating while I am not at home?\r\nYes, you can. But a direct connection to the Cube is required so you need to configure a VPN tunnel in your router and activate the tunnel in your phone.\r\nPortforwarding is also possible but strongly discouraged because it will essentially allow everybody to access your MAX! Cube from a remote location\r\n\r\n#### MAX! Remote fails to load the room information, what can I do?\r\nThe first thing you should check is that you entered the correct IP address to access the cube. You can switch back to the respective screen by selecting the `connect to cube` menu.\r\nAdditionally you should check that the wireless network is activated on your phone and that the cube is properly connected in the network.\r\nIf everything is in order you also need to ensure that all other applications that access the Cube directly are terminated because the Cube allows only one connection at a time.\r\n\r\n### TODOs\r\nThis is a list of enhancements/changes that are planned to develop or have been requested by users.\r\nThe list is in no particular order\r\n\r\n+ Show which heating profile is currently active\r\n+ Show when the data was last updated from the cube\r\n+ provide a historic chart that includes actual, desired and outside temperature as well as valve positions\r\n+ integrate into the `Tasker` App to enable more advanced use-cases\r\n+ Provide an in-app-purchase option to get rid of the ad\r\n+ When using the global `Auto` button all rooms should be set to the temperature defined in the week profile\r\n+ add google drive support to sync heating profiles\r\n+ improve layout for tablets\r\n+ when copying a day in the week profile there should be an `All days` option\r\n+ show optional notification on low battery or connectivity problem\r\n+ support vacation mode\r\n+ support time limited temperature changes\r\n+ provide buttons to set to `eco` or `comfort` temperature in a single room\r\n+ Add support for external temperature sensors\r\n+ Additonal device configurations\r\n    + set boost duration and valve position\r\n    + set wall thermostat display mode\r\n    + adjust device offset\r\n    + set cube time","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
